There is no code in this project--this is a conceptual design.  According to the terms of the NASA Space Apps challenge a GitHub repository was required to document and share it.

If you are a developer and would like to design and code algorithms and/or programs to operate the various control systems that would be needed to implement this, feel free to jump in and join me on this project!  You can reach me at nickapro@gmail.com.
