There is no code in this project--this is a conceptual design.  According to the terms of the NASA Space Apps challenge a GitHub repository was required to document and share it.

If you are a developer and would like to design and code algorithms and/or programs to operate the various control systems that would be needed to implement this, feel free to jump in and join me on this project!
